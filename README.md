# World_Happiness_Report
Web scraping tool to scrape a Wikipedia page on world happiness. These world happiness reports are published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. These reports are based on peopleâ€™s ratings and their perception of different quality of life factors from the Gallup World Poll. The rankings of happiness are based on a 0 to 10 scale.

I chose the most recent world happiness report for 2020. It ranked 153 countries based on an average rating between the years 2017-2019.
